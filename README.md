# PredictSolarFlare
This is a machine learning project which concerns on multi-task regression. 

For questions like several multiple regression problems are jointly, most existing regression method focus on estimating multiple variables separately and thus cannot utilize the useful correlation information among different variables. Multi-task learning is a new machine  learning technique, which could avoid the  weakness talked above.

In this project, I use multi-task Lasso and multi-task Elastic-Net to learn Solar Flare Database of UCI Machine Learning Repository and do prediction. Also, I also use powerful random forest method to learn this data set to make a comparison between multi-task learning and traditional independent learning method. And in this project, some unsupervized methods like feature selection and Dimensionality reduction are used to optimize the performance of my models.

The data1.txt is the data file and fin_run_me.py is my main code.

Key words: Machine Learning, Python, Regression, Multi-task
